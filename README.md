3) Find ChatGPT-File-Wrapper folder
4) Open the python "app.py" in a text editor (ie. right click -> open with -> Notes)
5) Replace "Your api key here" with the OpenAI API key you recieved. Format should be "KEY" between the quotes with no spaces between the key and the quotes. Save.

Windows - Right click on "requirements.txt" file, select "Copy as path"
          Open "Windows Powershell"
          type 'pip install -r [paste path]'
                 It should look like 'pip install -r "C:\Users\xxxxx\Desktop\ChatGPT-File-Wrapper\requirements.txt" ' 
                 Press enter and let all installations progress
7) After all packages are installed, double click the "app.py" folder and the app will launch.
8) Open the http address at the top of the black box, either by clicking on it or pasting it into any browser (ie. http://127.0.0.1:5000)
9) Ensure the black box is still open (it will provide error messages, etc.)


Run time is usually between 20-40 seconds per page of an uploaded PDF or powerpoint.
"Generate practice questions" will only work with a PDF at present. 
The top text box is the text to manipulate, the bottom text box is the prompt you want to apply to every page (no prompt is needed for generate practice questions)
