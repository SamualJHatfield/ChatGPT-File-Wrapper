Run time is usually between 20-40 seconds per page of an uploaded PDF or powerpoint.
"Generate practice questions" will only work with a PDF at present. 
The top text box is the text to manipulate, the bottom text box is the prompt you want to apply to every page (no prompt is needed for generate practice questions)
