Example:

Question:
A 35-year-old woman presents with joint pain for 3 months. This started first in her right 1-3 MCPs, then developed consecutively in the left 2nd & 3rd MCPs and bilateral 4th and 5th MTPs. Pain is worse in the mornings, improves with use, and is associated with 1.5 hours of morning stiffness. Her exam shows swelling in the affected joints. What is the clinical pattern of her joint complaints?

Answer Choices:
A Acute non-inflammatory symmetric polyarthritis of small and large joints 
B Chronic inflammatory symmetric polyarthritis of small joints 
C Acute inflammatory asymmetric oligoarthritis of small joints 
D Chronic non-inflammatory symmetric polyarthritis of small joints 
E Chronic non-inflammatory symmetric oligoarthritis of small joints 

Correct answer: B Chronic inflammatory symmetric polyarthritis of small joints

Explanation: 
This patient has a chronic presentation (> 6 weeks) of a symmetric (affects MCPs and MTPs on both sides of the body) polyarthritis (> 5 joints) affecting the small joints of the hands and feet (MCPs and MTPs). It is inflammatory since morning stiffness is > 1 hour. Therefore, option B is correct. She may have rheumatoid arthritis or one of its mimickers. Options D and E are incorrect due to the duration of morning stiffness. Duration of 3 months makes options A and C incorrect - acute is usually hours to days of symptoms at presentation. Options C and E are also incorrect due to the number of joints involved (oligoarthritis = 2-4 joints).

Explanations should state why the correct response is correct, as well as the specific reason why the incorrect answers are incorrect. Avoid stating "These options are incorrect as they do not match the description" or other things of that nature"\nUploaded Material: {chunk}'''
